This is Shawn's website. Here you can find my blogs, technical presentations, application demos, and even some cooking recipes I use.

I currently work at T-Mobile as software engineer. And I'm also a active member of [Atlanta Chinese IT association](http://www.atlchineseit.org/). Most of the ideas you see on this site are extracted from my experience in these places.

You are welcome to shoot me an email at me@shawn-cao.com if you found some bug here, any suggestions, or just want to say hello.
