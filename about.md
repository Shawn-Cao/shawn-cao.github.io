This is Shawn's website. Here you can find my blogs, technical presentations, application demos, and even some cooking recipes I use.

I started my US journey in Lubbock, Texas as an international student. After graduation, I moved to Atlanta for my first job, and stayed there for 4 years before moving to San francisco Bay Area. Software Engineering is a rewarding job, not just high pay but also to work with more smart people, plus working on smart ideas in the job environments. My interest was almost solely learning and to become a scholar, but during work I gradually start to enjoy interaction with people. Starting from talking at [Atlanta Chinese IT association](http://www.atlchineseit.org/) (hmm, the website no longer exists), I attended many local events and try to contribute. Gradually I found I also enjoys teach, namely sharing ideas. Maybe learn and teach natually fit, combining them yields more innovations. I feel that all my ideas are from learning or sharing, including items on this site, extracted from my work/life experiences.
