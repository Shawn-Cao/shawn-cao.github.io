1. Season both side of pork rib to your flavor, and lay into baking pan with meaty side up. I usually use soysauce, cumin, Sichuan peper, black peper, red chili and some oil based spicy sauce.
2. Cover rib with oven foil and roast at 220F for 2 hours. (+ 1 hour if frozen). The slow roast process breaks fat down to more liquid state which contribute to the tenderness. The key is to cover top of rib but leave space on the side to allow excess water to come outside and evaporate.
3. Remove cover, turn rib over to fatty side up. Rise temperature to 350F and bake for another 1/2 hour to dry the surface add some color. You can also do this in a barbeque setup to give it chacoralflavor.
