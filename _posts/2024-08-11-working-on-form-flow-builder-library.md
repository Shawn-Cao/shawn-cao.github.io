### Started working on [this project](https://github.com/Shawn-Cao/form-flow-builder). Trying to generalize something useful out of my work and hackweek projects. I initially thought it's so useful to general projects but soon found it overwheming to accomondate so many features.

## What this project should achieve
Better to be a starting point instead of a directly usable library. Cause most project don't need so many features. And having too much out-of-the-box hinders innovation. Plus loosing focus by having too many disorganized content.

Although, I do have a hope to achieve something more. Maybe a domain specific language to better describe forms? There are many contenders already on the market achieving more. My feeling after researching them is that the intent gets lost when adding more features. I should avoid that.
