1. Costco has thumb sized creamer potatos that are very tasty worth the extra price. Costo also sell large packages of "beef chuck short rib", which are even better marbled than normal rib eye steaks. They fit each other very good as a meal!
2. The tricky part is to properly brown the smaller size of meat without prolonged hearing. So let's raise oven temperature to 425F. I tried a few time and turns out 5 min for first side and 4 min for the 2nd side makes the best crisp shell and juicy inside combination.
3. For potatos, if you put washed potatos (slightly wet) into oven when heating up. They will be almost ready to eat at about the same time as steak. I just turn off oven when steak is done, let the steak rest on table and serve potatoes after serving meat to guests.
4. Depending on each oven's power to heat up and to retain heat. Adjust temperature setting to arrive the best recipe for your oven.
