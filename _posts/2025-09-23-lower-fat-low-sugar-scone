## Scone ##

### fat content ###

Scones use butter for texture, which make them a more fatty choice for snacks. This recipe reduces fat content by half, though still relatively high (Sadly this is typical for tasty snacks).

### Dry content (the base) ###

1 cup of flour (~120g)
1 teaspoon (4 grams) of baking powder
1/4 cup of sugar (or less if adding other add-in ingredients like dried fruit)
4 tbsp butter (half of a stick)

Mix top 3 ingredients and cut (or shred frozen) butter into the mix. Pat butter instead of kneading to keep the flakiness of the dough.

### Final dough ###

1 large egg
1/2 cup of milk
1/2 - 1 cup of dried fruit or chocolate 

Then, mix half of the egg yolk, all egg white with milk first. Then mix into the dough. Add-in stuffs last. I use a baker's spatula for the last step as the dough will be very wet.
I just roughly mix and spread the dough into 10 pieces and drop them into a greased/floured baking pan.


### Heating ###

Brush the 1/2 egg yolk on top of scone pieces. Bake then for 20 min at 375F. Adjust temperature and/or time for optimum rising and browning.
