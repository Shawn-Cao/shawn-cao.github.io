3 hours

beef stripes: 2 lb of brisket or chunk. Cut along the fiber, into stripes
ginger: cut similar to beef stripes. 50 grams

(I don't remember other ingredients, Li please correct me. lol)
soy sauce: generous amount, maybe 3 cups. it contributes to color also
dried red chili: 1 cup (break into halves for more heat)
sugar: Enough sugar to saturate your taste. Fructose may be better.
salt: add to taste.
herbs: star anise, bay leaves, cumin

## Preparation ##
1. Heat seasonings in oil to bring out flavor. Sift out seasonings.
2. Add suguar to oil prepared in step 1. Heat until melt.
3. Add beef stripes. Slowly saute till cooked and beef turns slightly golden.
4. Remove from heat. Package and refrigerate.
5. Serve chilled. This dish taste best after refrigerate for a day. (probably the flavors take time to soak in)
