Ideas are the core, and the only core in software products. One can always invest and catch up competetors in features through different approach, but the better product is always the one with better ideas.

Take example of WeChat vs Momo. WeChat's is about mobile specific platform, its focus on mobile specific concerns made it succesful. On the other hand, Momo gained it's track from privacy concerns on mobile networking, but distracted later on non-core features copied from popular networking apps. The loose on focus made Momo less popular, and other apps started to emerge on top of the same ideas.

I'm not an entrepreneur yet so I couldn't figure out the stories behind. I'm conclusing these to leadership problem. Leadership in IT companies, which are intrinsically idea based, should focus on ideas, and the competetiveness of those ideas. I've seen big companies spending millions dollars elaborating on slightly outdated ideas. Always, turns out the slightly outdating, if left unaddressed, is costing them the whole project...
